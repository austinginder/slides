					### Building a WordPress Maintenance CLI *with AI*

					## Introducing `_do`

					## Backstory
					- Years of random bash scripts, [like this one](https://anchor.host/identifying-bottleneck-plugins/).
					- Random conversations with Google Gemini.📱
					- Not a good way for others to use them. My toolkit CaptainCore is a beast to self-host.
					- `_do` is a new way to run automated tasks.

						CaptainCore `_do` is made so other WordPress developers can use my automatted scripts.

					## Coding architectures
					| Single file | Many files |
					| -------- | ------- |
					| Simple yet messy | Increased complexity yet organized |
					| Cowboy coder | Maintainable codebase |
					| Easier to distribute | Requires build step |
					| Easier to use AI coding | Requires extra steps AI coding | 
				</section>

					## `_do` architecture
					Started as a single file `_do.sh` and then breaked it into multiple files for better a maintainable codebase. Then added two scripts `watch.sh` and `compile.sh` to automate compiling back to a single file for distribution.

						### AI's ability to generate code is limited by it's context window

						### A context window is simply how much infomation you and put into and get out of AI in a single request

					### Google Gemini 2.5
					| Input | Output |
					| -------- | ------- |
					| 1 million tokens | 64k tokens |
					| ~2-3 MBs | ~244 KBs |

					1 token ≈ 4 characters

					### Mixing AI code generation with human coding seems to be a good process.

					1. Generate code with Google Gemini
					2. Test code and modify as needed
					3. `_do dump` and repeat

						AI is really good at looking at an existing code base and following it's structure.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						AI is really good at looking at generating a readme.md file based on the code itself.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						AI is really good at looking at generating a changelog.

						Recommendations
						- Use Google Gemini for a side project
						- Try using Google Gemini on an existing project
						- Try using Google Gemini on a new project
